# PSD Synchronization

Work in progress.

A package for handling PSD files in Unity, allowing for both reading and writing. It supports text fields and smart objects.

Right now, my focus is on PSD reading. Please don't hesitate to report any bugs or share your suggestions.

The import window is found in the "Assets/Import PSD file" menu.

With some modifications, this code can be used in any C# project.
