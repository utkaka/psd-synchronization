# PSD Synchronization

Work in progress.

A package for handling PSD files in Unity, allowing for both reading and writing. It supports text fields and smart objects.

Right now, my focus is on PSD reading. Please don't hesitate to report any bugs or share your suggestions.

With some modifications, this code can be used in any C# project.

### Installation
- clone/download this repository and move the Plugins folder to your Unity project's Assets folder
- (via Package Manager) add the following line to Packages/manifest.json: "com.utkaka.psd-synchronization": "https://github.com/utkaka/psd-synchronization.git",

The import window is found in the "Assets/Import PSD file" menu.
